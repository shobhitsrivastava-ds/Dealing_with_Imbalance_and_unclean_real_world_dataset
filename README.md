# Dealing_with_Imbalance_and_unclean_real_world_dataset

The data used in this project is imbalanced. In real life, some extremely critical situations result in imbalanced data sets. For example – fraud detection, cancer detection, manufacturing defects, online ads conversion etc. Thus, having prior experience of working on such data might rule the situation in your favor (worth a try!).

Furthermore, some characteristics of this project which makes it a worthy project include:

   * Working on imbalanced data sets is tricky. Simple classification algorithms tend to struggle in such situations.
   * The data is fairly large and high dimensional. Hence, this would help you understand & overcome machine’s memory issues.
   * This project will demonstrate your programming, data analysis and machine learning skills.
   * Working on such projects driven by self – desire will help recruiters understand:
     You are a self motivated person
   * Mostly, self learners tend to give up. But, you have really put in hard work to reach where you are.
